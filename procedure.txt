    			'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    			'django.contrib.sessions',
    			'django.contrib.messages',
    			'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    			'catalog.apps.CatalogConfig', 
				]
Second Day
	Second Step : Now we have to define database schema for web app. It includes Book, Author, Genere, Language, BookInstance etc as per the requirement.

	1. Navigate to project folder i.e C:/harshit/library/catalog and describe model.py with database schema.
	2. Then go to admin.py and import database
	 i.e    from .models import Author, Genre, Book, BookInstance, Language  
	   note : (we can make define admin.py more efficiently as done by me) 
	3. Open powershell and hit command
	   python manage.py makemigrations
	   python manage.py migrate 
	   note : (This will initiate database)


	 
	4. Now we have to create a super user( admin to  make changes in database)
	 hit command in powershell in the same directory
      python manage.py createsuperuser
      (now enter your username, e-mail, password)
    5. Now check you project by running the server
      python manage.py runserver
